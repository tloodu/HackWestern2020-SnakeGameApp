Solaris is a web application that makes the act of waking up in the morning a more pleasant and fun experience. With this site, users will set the wakeup time in the same manner as any other clock app but this time, when the alarm goes off, they must beat a snake game in order to turn off the alarm noise. By taking the normally grueling activity of waking up and making it a more enjoyable experience, Solaris functions as a more effective alarm app that allows users to be more successful with waking up on time.

# Inspiration  
As students, we all understand the difficulties of waking up for those early morning classes and just how easy it is to turn off the alarm and go back to sleep; thus missing those early morning starts.
