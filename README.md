# Solaris 
**Hack Western 7**  
November 20-22 2020

Solaris is a web application that makes the act of waking up in the morning a more pleasant and fun experience. With this site, users will set the wakeup time in the same manner as any other clock app but this time, when the alarm goes off, they must beat a snake game in order to turn off the alarm noise. By taking the normally grueling activity of waking up and making it a more enjoyable experience, Solaris functions as a more effective alarm app that allows users to be more successful with waking up on time.

## Inspiration  
As students, we all understand the difficulties of waking up for those early morning classes and just how easy it is to turn off the alarm and go back to sleep; thus missing those early morning starts. 

## What it does 
Solaris is a web application that makes the act of waking up in the morning a more pleasant and fun experience. With this site, users will set the wakeup time in the same manner as any other clock app but this time, when the alarm goes off, they must beat a snake game in order to turn off the alarm noise. By taking the normally grueling activity of waking up and making it a more enjoyable experience, Solaris functions as a more effective alarm app that allows users to be more successful with waking up on time.  

## How we built it  
We created this application using HTML, CSS and Javascript (React). The Homepage of this website was created using React and styled with CSS to achieve a simple-to-use user interface. The Snake game portion of this application was created using HTML and styled using CSS. The snake game is credited to Steven Lambert who created a license-free and open-source snake game at https://gist.github.com/straker/ff00b4b49669ad3dec890306d348adc4. With this code we were able to style it and add additional features which would create a better environment for our users.

## Challenges we ran into 
There were quite a few challenges we ran into involving the creation of the home page. At first, we were rusty with using React, and thus it took some time to get used to the working environment once again, such as creating the dynamic clock and alarm clock. Other challenges included figuring out Git and text editors for someone who is new to the working environment.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are quite proud of what we accomplished, learning more and becoming familiar with web-design. We came into this event lacking knowledge in certain fields, but definitely left stronger!
